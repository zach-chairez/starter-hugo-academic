Hi there! I'm Zach, I'm currenly a Ph.D. student in the department of Mathematics at the University of Texas at Arlington.  I'm currently working under Dr. Ren-Cang Li and Dr. Li Wang in the field of Machine Learning with a focus in Multi-view Learning.  My current research involves extending single-view machine learning models to multi-view scenarios and creating algorithms to solve them.  I've been tutoring and teaching mathematics periodically over the years with students in K-12 up to college.  More recently, I've been working in the university while tutoring high school students privately.  When I'm not working, I enjoy running, playing soccer, spending time with my girlfriend, and taking a copious amount of naps.
